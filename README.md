## Overview

Flux is a **fully offline AI assistant** for Android. It runs quantized LLMs directly on your device using `llamadart` (llama.cpp bindings). No accounts, no cloud, no data leaving your phone — ever.

But it can also **search the web** when you want it to, combining the privacy of local inference with the freshness of live search results.

## Features

### Offline AI Chat

| Model | Size | RAM | What it's good at |
|-------|------|-----|-------------------|
| **Flux Lite** | 533 MB | 4 GB+ | Quick answers, low-end devices |
| **Flux Steady** | 1.3 GB | 6 GB+ | Balanced reasoning and speed |
| **Flux Smart** | 2.7 GB | 8 GB+ | Complex reasoning, deep analysis |

All models are GGUF quantizations of **Qwen 3.5**, downloaded directly from Hugging Face inside the app.

### Web Search

Toggle the globe icon in the chat bar and Flux will:
1. Fetch live results from DuckDuckGo
2. Inject them into the model's context as authoritative sources
3. Show a **"Searched"** badge and the actual **source chips** you can tap

When search is off, everything runs 100% offline.

### App Builder ("Creations")

Describe an HTML/CSS/JS mini-app in natural language and Flux Lite will build it. The app gets a live preview, auto-saves to your collection, and you can run, edit, or delete creations.

### Conversation History

Every chat auto-saves. The history sidebar lets you browse, rename, or delete past conversations. When you tap an old chat, the model used for that conversation is automatically restored.

### Context Management

Flux compacts its context window every 4 messages — older turns are summarized so the prompt stays lean. The model never claims it "doesn't remember" because its system prompt explicitly tells it: *"You have perfect memory of this conversation."*

### Long Responses Without Crashing

Streaming is throttled to ~6 UI updates per second instead of hundreds. Responses longer than 8,000 tokens automatically continue in the background (up to 3 continuations) so no output gets cut off.

### Localized UI

The entire interface is translated into **6 languages**:

| Language | Locale |
|----------|--------|
| English | `en` |
| Spanish | `es` |
| French | `fr` |
| German | `de` |
| Italian | `it` |
| Chinese | `zh` |

## Privacy

Flux is built with privacy as a hard requirement:

- **No account** — download and start using immediately
- **No cloud** — inference runs locally via llama.cpp
- **No telemetry** — zero analytics, zero tracking
- **No internet needed** — fully offline when search is toggled off
- **Open source** — every line of code is auditable

---

## Roadmap

- [x] Offline AI chat with 3 model sizes
- [x] Web search with source display
- [x] HTML/CSS/JS app builder (Creations)
- [x] Conversation history with model restoration
- [x] Context window compaction
- [x] 6-language localization
- [x] Performance: throttled streaming, continuations, debouncing
- [ ] Image / vision model support
- [ ] Voice input
- [ ] Export conversations (JSON / text)
- [ ] iOS version
